<h1>Glossary of Terms</h1>
</div>
<p><b>Absolute Dating</b>: collective term for techniques that assign specific dates or date ranges, in calendar years, to artifacts and other archaeological finds. Dates are determined by a variety of processes, including chemical analyses (as in radiocarbon dating and thermoluminescence), data correlation (as in dendrochronology), and a variety of other tests. See Relative Dating.</p>
<p><b>AMS</b>: Accelerator Mass Spectrometry is an absolute dating technique that measures the amount of carbon-14 in an organic object and provides a rough indication of its age.</p>
<p><b>Anthropology</b>: the study of human beings, including their behavior, biology, linguistics, and social and cultural variations. In the United States, anthropology is divided into four sub-disciplines: archaeology, biological/physical anthropology, cultural anthropology, and linguistics. All the sub-disciplines study aspects of past or present humans. Archaeologists generally study the physical and material remains of ancient societies, while cultural anthropologists study living cultures. Physical anthropologists study human skeletons and other bodily remains. Biological anthropologists deal primarily with the evolution of humans and primates. Linguists study languages, especially their development and their function within human culture.</p>
<p><b>Archaeology</b>: the scientific study of past human cultures by analyzing the material remains (sites and artifacts) that people left behind.  </p>
<p><b>Archaeological site</b>: a place where human activity occurred and material remains were deposited. </p>
<p><b>Artifact</b>: any object made, modified, or used by people.  </p>
<p><b>Assemblage</b>: artifacts that are found together and that presumably were used at the same time or for similar or related tasks.</p>
<p><b>Attribute</b>: a characteristic or property of an object, such as weight, size, or color.</p>
<p><b>B.P.</b>: years before present; as a convention, 1950 is the year from which B.P. dates are calculated.</p>
<p><b>Cache (pronounced "cash")</b>: a collection of objects that was purposefully buried.</p>
<p><b>Ceramic</b>: pottery, fired clay.</p>
<p id="chert"><b>Chert</b>: a compact rock consisting essentially of microcrystalline quartz. Used for making stone tools.</p>
<p id="chipped"><b>Chipped stone tool</b>: stone tool made by striking a stone (core or preform) with another stone (hammerstone) or other hard material (such as antler). Small pieces of stone (flakes) were struck off the core in a controlled and precise manner to create a usable shape (arrow heads, spear points, knives, etc.). The two main techniques of creating chipped tools were direct percussion (the core is struck directly with a hammerstone) and indirect percussion (another object is placed between the core and the hammerstone).</p>
<p><b>Chronology</b>: an arrangement of events in the order in which they occurred.</p>
<p><b>Classification</b>: a systematic arrangement in groups or categories according to criteria.</p>
<p id="component"><b>Component</b>: a site or layer that belongs to one culture and is interpreted as the remains of a single people during a relatively brief period of time.</p>
<p><b>Context</b>: the relationship of artifacts and other cultural remains to each other and the situation in which they are found.</p>
<p id="core"><b>Core</b>:A core is the base rock from which flakes are broken off to make chipped stone tools. You can learn more about cores <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithic_core">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>Culture</b>: a set of learned beliefs, values and behaviors--the way of life--shared by the members of a society.</p>
<p id="debitage"><b>Debitage</b>: the by-products or waste materials left over from the manufacture of stone tools.</p>
<p><b>Diagnostic artifact</b>: an item that is indicative of a particular time period and/or cultural group.</p>
<p><b>Excavation</b>: the systematic digging and recording of an archaeological site.</p>
<p><b>Experimental archaeology</b>: scientific studies designed to discover processes that produced and/or modified artifacts and sites.</p>
<p id="feature"><b>Feature</b>: a type of material remain that cannot be removed from a site such as roasting pits, fire hearths, house floors or post molds.</p>
<p><b>Grid</b>: a network of uniformly spaced squares that divides a site into units; used to measure and record an object's position in space.</p>
<p id="hearth"><b>Hearth</b>: the location of a fire.</p>
<p><b>In situ</b>: in the original place.</p>
<p id="latewoodland"><b>Late Woodland</b>: this archaeological classification is used for the people who lived from AD 500 to contact with Europeans.</p>
<p><b>Level</b>: an excavation layer, which may correspond to natural strata. Levels are numbered from the top to bottom of the excavation unit, with the uppermost level being Level 1.</p>
<p><b>Lithic</b>: stone, or made of stone.</p>
<p id="mammoth"><b>Mammoth</b>: any large, <a href="img/mammoth1.jpg"> elephantlike mammal</a> of the extinct genus Mammuthus, from the Pleistocene Epoch, having hairy skin and ridged molar teeth.</p>
<p id="mastodon"><b> Mastodon</b>: a massive, <a href="img/mastodon1.jpg"> elephantlike mammal</a> of the genus Mammut (Mastodon), that flourished worldwide from the Miocene through the Pleistocene epochs and, in North America, into recent times, having long, curved upper tusks and, in the male, short lower tusks.</p>
<p><b>Material remains</b>: artifacts, features and other items such as plant and animal remains that indicate human activity.</p>
	<p id="metallurgic"><b>Metallurgic</b>:the technique or science of working or heating metals so as to give them certain desired shapes or properties.</p>
	<p id="midden"><b>Midden</b>: an area used for trash disposal.</p>
<p id="middlearchaic"><b>Middle Archaic</b>: this archaeological classification is used for those people who lived here from about 8,000 to 5,000 years ago.  This was a time of changing climatic conditions in which the area may have become significantly drier and warmer than it is today.</p>	
<p id="middlewoodland"><b>Middle Woodland</b>:in the classification of archaeological cultures, the Middle Woodland period spanned a period from roughly 200 BC to AD 500.</p> 
	<p id="OSL"><b>OSL</b>:OSL, or optically-stimulated luminescence, is a dating technique that is used to date the last time quartz sediment was exposed to light. It can be used to date buried deposits, measuring the last time they were exposed to light.</p>
	<p id="ossuary"><b>Ossuary</b>: built structure to hold a number of burials. Archaeologically, the structure seldom remains.</p>
<p id="paleo-indian"><b>Paleo-Indian</b>: an archaeological classification for those people who inhabited the Americans during the Late Pleistocene, the end of the last Ice Age. </p>

<p id="pictograph"><b>Pictograph</b>: a picture or symbol painted or drawn on to a surface, as opposed to engraved on to it.</p>
<p id="plow"><b>Plow zone</b>: the top layer of the soil to the depth at which a plow will penetrate and disturb archaeological deposits.</p>
<p id="postmold"><b>Post mold / post hole</b>: a type of feature; a circular stain left in the ground after a wooden post has decayed; usually indicates the former existence of a house or fence.</p>
<p><b>Prehistoric</b>: the period of time before written records; the absolute date for the prehistoric period varies from place to place.</p>
<p><b>Projectile point</b>: a general term for stone points that were hafted to darts, spears or arrows; often erroneously called "arrowheads".</p>
<p id="carbon"><b>Radiocarbon dating</b>: a method for determining the age of an object containing organic material by using the properties of radiocarbon (C14), a radioactive isotope of carbon.</p>
	<p id="radiographic"><b>Radiographic</b>:radiographic testing makes use of x-rays to view the internal structure of a non-transparent object of varying density and composition. </p>
	<p><b>Rock art</b>: a general term for pecked, incised, or painted figures on rock.</p>
<p id="sherd"><b>Sherd</b>: a broken fragment of pottery.</p>

<p id="stratified"><b>Stratified</b>: divided into distinct layers. </p>
<p><b>Stratigraphy</b>: the layering of deposits in archaeological sites. Cultural remains and natural sediments become buried over time, forming strata.</p>
<p><b>Survey</b>: the systematic examination of the ground surface in search of archaeological sites.</p>
